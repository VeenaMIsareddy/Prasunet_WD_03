Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with two players, X and O, taking turns marking a square on the grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The project consists of:

- An HTML file (task3.html) that sets up the game board and user interface
- A CSS file (task3.css) that styles the game board and user interface
- A JavaScript file (task3.js) that handles game logic, player turns, and win conditions

The game features:

- A 3x3 grid game board with clickable squares
- Player X and O symbols displayed on the board
- A status display showing whose turn it is
- A reset button to start a new game

This project demonstrates basic web development skills, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript programming. It's a great starting point for building more complex games and interactive webÂ applications.
